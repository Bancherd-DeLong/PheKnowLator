### Getting Started

**Dependencies:**  
- [x] This program requires Python version 3.6. To install required modules, run the following:  

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ``` 
- [x] Run the  **[`Data_Preparation.ipynb`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/Data_Preparation.ipynb)** notebook to build mapping and filtering datasets. 
- [x] ‚Äº **Important.** This code depends on four documents in order to run successfully. See Step 1 below for more details.
- [x] [OWLTools](https://github.com/owlcollab/owltools) library. Please download it to `resources/lib/` prior to running `main.py`. 
- [x] Knowledge graph embeddings are generated using [n1-standard1](https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing#n1_predefined) Google Compute virtual machines.  

<br>

**Data Sources:** This knowledge graph is built entirely on linked open data and [Open Biomedical Ontologies](http://obofoundry.org/) (which we are very grateful for
 üôè üôá‚Äç‚ôÄ). Please see the [Data Source](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/wiki/Data-Sources) Wiki page for
  information on the data we use.

<br>

**Running Code:**

This program can be run using a Jupyter Notebook ([`main.ipynb`](https://github.com/callahantiff/pheknowlator/blob/master/main.ipynb)) or from the command line ([`main.py`](https://github.com/callahantiff/pheknowlator/blob/master/main.py)) by:

    ```
    python3 Main.py -h
    
    usage: Main.py [-h] -o ONTS -c CLS -i INST
    
    PheKnowLator: This program builds a biomedical knowledge graph using Open
    Biomedical Ontologies and linked open data. The programs takes the following arguments:
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -o ONTS, --onts ONTS  name/path to text file containing ontologies
      -c CLS, --cls CLS     name/path to text file containing class sources
      -i INST, --inst INST  name/path to text file containing instance sources
    ```

#### Workflow   
The [KG Construction](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/wiki/KG-Construction) Wiki page provides a detailed description of the knowledge construction process. A brief overview of this process is also provided
  provided below. 

**STEP 1: Prepare Input Documents**  
This code depends on four documents in order to run successfully. For information on what's included in these documents, see the [Document Dependencies](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/wiki/Dependencies) Wiki page. For assistance in creating these documents, please run the following:
   ```bash
   python ./scripts/python/CreatesInputDocuments.py
   ```

**STEP 2: Download and Preprocess Data**
 - <u>Create Mapping and Filtering Data</u>: The **[`Data_Preparation.ipynb`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/Data_Preparation.ipynb)** assists with the downloading and processing of all data needed to help build the knowledge graph. 
 - <u>Download Ontologies</u>: Downloads ontologies with or without imports from the `ontology_source_list.txt` file. Once the ontology has downloaded, metadata information from each ontology will be saved to `ontology_source_metadata.txt`, which is located within the `resources/ontologies` directory.
 - <u>Download Class Data</u>: Downloads data that is used to create connections between ontology concepts treated as classes and instance data from the `class_source_list.txt` file. Once 
    the data has downloaded, metadata information from each source will be saved to `class_source_metadata.txt`, which is located within the `resources/text_files` directory. 
 - <u>Download Instance Data</u>: Downloads data from the `instance_source_list.txt` file. Once the data has downloaded, metadata information from each source will be saved to `instance_source_metadata.txt`, which is located within the `resources/text_files` directory.   

**STEP 3: Create Edge Lists**  
 - Create edges between classes and instances of classes.  
 - Create edges between instances of classes and instances of data.  

**STEP 4: Build Knowledge Graph**  
1. Merge ontologies used as classes.  
2. Add class-instance and instance-instance edges to merged ontologies.  
3. Remove disjointness axioms.  
4. Deductively close knowledge graph using [Elk reasoner](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/tools/ELK/)  
5. Remove edges that are not clinically meaningful.  
6. Write edges (as triples) to local directory.  
7. Convert original edges to integers and write to local directory (required input format for generating embeddings).

**STEP 5: Generate Mechanism Embeddings**  
To create estimates of molecular mechanisms, we embed knowledge graph information extracted by [DeepWalk](https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk). This repository contains code to run two versions of the [original method](http://www.perozzi.net/publications/14_kdd_deepwalk.pdf) developed by [Bryan Perozzi](https://github.com/phanein):    
 -  **[DeepWalk algorithm-C](https://github.com/xgfs/deepwalk-c):** an implementation of the original algorithm in C
 ++ (with some improvements to speed up initialize the hierarchical softmax tree that was developed by [Anton Tsitsulin](https://github.com/xgfs).  
 - **[DeepWalk-RDF`](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/walking-rdf-and-owl):** an extension of the
  original algorithm that also embeds graph edges; developed by [the Bio-Ontology Research Group](https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/walking-rdf-and-owl).  
    - ‚Äº **Note:** This library depends on the [C++ Boost library](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/04/27/installing-boost-and-boost-python-on-osx-with-homebrew/) and [Boost Threadpool Header Files](http://threadpool.sourceforge.net/). For the Headers, the sub-directory called `Boost` at the top-level of the `walking-rdf-and-owl-master` directory. In order to compile and run `Deepwalk-RDF`, there are a few important changes that will need to be made:  
      - Change `TIME_UTC` to `TIME_UTC_` in the `boost/threadpool/task_adaptors.hpp`.  
      - Change the `-lboost_thread` argument to `-lboost_thread-mt` in the `walking-rdf-and-owl-master/Makefile` 
      - To troubleshoot incompatibility issues between Deepwalk and Gensim, run the following in this order:  
        - `pip uninstall gensim`  
        - `pip uninstall deepwalk`  
        - `pip install gensim==0.10.2` 
        - `pip install deepwalk`
