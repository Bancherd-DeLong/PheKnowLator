### Getting Started

**ðŸ›‘ Dependencies ðŸ›‘**  
- [x] This program requires Python version 3.6. To install required modules, run the following:  
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ``` 
- [x] Run the  **[`Data_Preparation.ipynb`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/Data_Preparation.ipynb)** notebook to build mapping, filtering, and labeling datasets. 
- [x] **Important.** This code depends on four documents in order to run successfully. See **STEP 1: Prepare Input
 Documents** below for more 
 details.
- [x] [OWLTools](https://github.com/owlcollab/owltools) library. Please download it to `resources/lib/` prior to running `main.py`. 
- [x] Knowledge graph embeddings are generated using [n1-standard1](https://cloud.google.com/compute/vm-instance-pricing#n1_predefined) Google Compute virtual machines.  

<br>

**Data Sources:** This knowledge graph is built entirely on publicly available linked open data and [Open Biomedical Ontologies](http://obofoundry.org/).
  - Please see the [Data Source](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/wiki/Data-Sources) Wiki page for
  information.

<br>

**Running Code:**  
This program can be run using a Jupyter Notebook ([`main.ipynb`](https://github.com/callahantiff/pheknowlator/blob/master/main.ipynb)) or from the command line ([`main.py`](https://github.com/callahantiff/pheknowlator/blob/master/main.py)) by:

``` bash
python3 Main.py -h
    
usage: Main.py [-h] -o ONTS -c CLS -i INST
    
PheKnowLator: This program builds a biomedical knowledge graph using Open Biomedical Ontologies and linked open data. The programs takes the following arguments:
    
optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -o ONTS, --onts ONTS  name/path to text file containing ontologies
    -c CLS, --cls CLS     name/path to text file containing class sources
    -i INST, --inst INST  name/path to text file containing instance sources
```

#### Workflow   
The [KG Construction](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/wiki/KG-Construction) Wiki page provides a detailed description of the knowledge construction process. A brief overview of this process is also provided
  provided below. 

 **STEP 0: Select the Build Type**  
 The knowledge graph build algorithm has been designed to run from three different stages of development: `full`, `partial`, and `post-closure`. For details on each of these, please see the table below.

Build Type | Description | Use Cases  
:--: | -- | --   
`full` | Runs all build steps in the algorithm | You want to build a KG and will not use a reasoner  
`partial` | Runs all of the build steps in the algorithm through adding the `class-class`, `instance-class`, `class-instance`, and `instance-instance` edges<br><br> If `node_data` is provided, it will not be added to the KG, but instead used to filter the edges such that only those edges with valid node metadata are added to the KG<br><br> Node metadata can always be added to a `partial` built KG by running the build as `post-closure` | You want to build a KG and plan to run a reasoner over it<br><br> You want to build a KG, but do not want to include node metadata, filter OWL semantics, or generate triple lists  
`post-closure` | Adds node metadata (if `node_data='yes'`), determines whether owl semantics should be filtered, creates and writes triple lists, and writes node metadata | You have run the `partial` build, ran a reasoner over it, and now want to complete the algorithm<br><br> You want to use the algorithm to process metadata and owl semantics for an externally built KG

**STEP 1: Prepare Input Documents**  
This code depends on four documents in order to run successfully. For information on what's included in these documents, see the [Document Dependencies](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/wiki/Dependencies) Wiki page.

For assistance in creating these documents, please run the following:
```bash
   python ./scripts/python/CreatesInputDocuments.py
```

<br>

**STEP 2: Download and Preprocess Data**  
   <br>
_PREPROCESS DATA:_  
 - <u>Create Mapping, Filtering, and Labeling Data</u>: The **[`Data_Preparation.ipynb`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/Data_Preparation.ipynb)** assists with the downloading and processing of all data needed to help build the knowledge graph.   

_DOWNLOAD DATA:_  
 - <u>Download Ontologies</u>: Downloads ontologies with or without imports from the [`ontology_source_list.txt
   `](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/resources/ontology_source_list.txt) file. Metadata
    information from each ontology is saved to [`ontology_source_metadata.txt`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/resources/ontologies/ontology_source_metadata.txt) directory.
 - <u>Download Class Data</u>: Downloads data that is used to create connections between ontology concepts treated
   as classes and instance data from the [`class_source_list.txt`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/resources/class_source_list.txt) file. Metadata information from each source is saved
    to [`class_source_metadata.txt`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/resources/edge_data/class_source_metadata.txt) directory. 
 - <u>Download Instance Data</u>: Downloads data from the [`instance_source_list.txt`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/resources/instance_source_list.txt) file. Metadata information
    from each source is saved to [`instance_source_metadata.txt`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/blob/master/resources/edge_data/instance_source_metadata.txt) directory.   

<br>

**STEP 3: Create Edge Lists**  
 - Create edges between classes and instances of classes.  
 - Create edges between instances of classes and instances of data.  

<br>

**STEP 4: Build Knowledge Graph**  
1. Merge ontologies used as classes.  
2. Add class-instance and instance-instance edges to merged ontologies.  
3. Remove disjointness axioms.  
4. Deductively close knowledge graph using [Elk reasoner](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/isg/tools/ELK/)  
5. Remove edges that are not clinically meaningful.  
6. Write edges (as triples) to local directory.  
7. Convert original edges to integers and write to local directory (required input format for generating embeddings).

<br>

**STEP 5: Generate Mechanism Embeddings**  
To create estimates of molecular mechanisms, we embed knowledge graph information extracted by [DeepWalk](https://github.com/phanein/deepwalk). Please see this [`README.md`](https://github.com/callahantiff/PheKnowLator/tree/master/resources/embeddings) for details.
